# Night Life Coordination App

My second rendition of the [FreeCode Camp backend project]("https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app"). 

My first version was built utilizing the React and Redux. While I am a big fan of these technologies, I wanted to become better versed in more serve-side libraries. 

I wanted to fulfill all of the user stories by letting Express and Mongoose handle the bulk of the weight rather than tools like React Router. I also wanted to finally learn how to use Gulp in a project.   

###User Stories:
	+Search by city for bars and night clubs using the Yelp api
	+See the number of people attending any given bar in the search results
	+Log in and RSVP/cancel for any given bar in the search results
	+User can log in and be returned to his/her last route

###ToDo:
	+Make responsive
	+Implement additional login strategies
	+Automatically expire a users "RSVP"
	+Hover over RSVP button and see tooltip with user list
	+Perhaps a profile route to show users previously attended places
